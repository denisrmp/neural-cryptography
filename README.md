Neural-Cryptography
===================

A python implementation of the Neural Cryptography algorithm.
The Neural Cryptography algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cryptography) describes a key exchange protocol. 
Further information is avaliable (in portuguese) in a [short paper](http://www.peotta.com/sbseg2011/resources/downloads/wticg/92045.pdf) about this implementation  
and in more datails in a [longer text](http://aberto.univem.edu.br/handle/11077/357Neural-Cryptography).
